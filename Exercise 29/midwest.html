    <p>The Midwest region had another strong sales year with record-setting sales of both the M300-25 and M100-11 models. The only disappointment was the lackluster sales of the M300-15 model, which started the year strong but tapered off into the fourth quarter. All-in-all though, a very good year for the Midwest region.</p>
